    <h1>
        Welcome to a little about me </h1> 
    <h5>I grew up mostly in Texas.  I miss the mild winters and awesome thunderstorms.</h5>
    <h5>I spent my high school years in Virgina at the Virginia School of the Arts.  
        I was a serious dancer for a while and danced professionally for about 4 years after I graduated.
    </h5>
    <h6>I went to college, got married, went to law school, and we had 6 children.
    </h6>
    <h6>My favorite pastimes are reading, writing, and going on adventures with my family.</h6>
    <h6>Not right now, but someday I want a new house and a new car.  For now, I've got the best husband.</h6>
    
    <h6>I am completely converted to a whole food plant based way of life.
        That means I don't eat any animal products at all and try to eat only food that's in 
        it's original packaging.  Like I don't drink apple juice, but I eat apples. 
    </h6>
    <h6>I'd love to get a book published someday. I'm learning to code.  
        I don't know if I love it yet.</h6>
